# zapier-platform-app-converted-full-test

This is a full test app for the [`zapier-platform-legacy-scripting-runner`](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-legacy-scripting-runner).

It tests all kinds of supported auth/trigger/action/search possibilities for scripting.

It's what a WB app that did _everything_ would look like, converted to CLI.

To test, clone this repo, then `npm install` and `zapier test` away!

Pro-tip: use `zapier test --skip-validate` for a quicker test experience.
